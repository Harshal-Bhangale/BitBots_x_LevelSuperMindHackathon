Hello Everyone, We Team Bit Bots,

          This project demonstrates how AI, GPT integration, and database technologies enhance social media analytics by simulating engagement data and providing actionable insights. Using DataStax Astra DB for efficient data storage and Langflow with GPT integration for AI-driven workflows, the module analyzes post performance metrics such as likes, shares, and comments across different post types (e.g., Reels, Carousels). The GPT integration generates meaningful insights, helping content creators optimize strategies, improve engagement, and make data-driven decisions. This approach reduces manual effort, enhances content effectiveness, and empowers smarter social media management.
